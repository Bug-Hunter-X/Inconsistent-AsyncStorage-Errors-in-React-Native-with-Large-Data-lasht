# Inconsistent AsyncStorage Errors in React Native with Large Data

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native's AsyncStorage when dealing with large amounts of data or complex JSON objects. The issue manifests as inconsistent errors, sometimes working flawlessly and other times throwing cryptic exceptions or failing silently.  This is primarily caused by improperly handled asynchronous operations, especially when performing multiple `setItem` and `getItem` calls concurrently.

The `AsyncStorageBug.js` file shows the buggy code, illustrating scenarios where these errors frequently arise. The solution, detailed in `AsyncStorageBugSolution.js`, provides improved asynchronous handling for a more robust and reliable application.
