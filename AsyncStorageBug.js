In React Native, an uncommon error arises when using AsyncStorage with large amounts of data or complex objects.  The error manifests inconsistently, sometimes working, sometimes failing silently or throwing an unexpected error like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.setItem')` or `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.getItem')`. This usually happens because of asynchronous operations not being properly handled, particularly when multiple simultaneous `setItem` and `getItem` calls are performed.
